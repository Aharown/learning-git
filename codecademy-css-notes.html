            Declarations are essential to CSS because they apply a style to a selected element. We use selectors to decide which elements get the style.
            A selector in css will specify the html element to be targeted by the declaration.
            Below the colour of the P element is changed through use of a selector and declaration:<br/><br/>
         </p>
         
         p {
            colour: green; 
         }
         <h2>
            Selectors: Universal
         </h2>
           <p>
            The type selector selects all elements of a given type such as “p”, “h1” etc. The universal selector selects all elements of any type.
            Universal selectors are used when we want to reset the default browser styling OR select all the children elements of a parent element.
            <br/><br/>

            * {
                font-family: verdana;
            }
           </p>
           <p>
            The asterisk is used as to symbolise universal and is used in place of the type selector.
