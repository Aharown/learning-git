JSON: WHAT IS IT?


JSON (JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION) is a data representation format. Another example of a data representation format would be XML.
JSON is commonly used in APIs across the web as well as configs 


WHY IS JSON POPULAR?

-JSON is extremely lightweight meaning that the file sizes are easy to send. 

-Easier to read compared to XLM.

-Integrates very well with JS.

-All major languages have built in functionality to parse JSON strings into objects or classes in that language.


JSON TYPES:

Strings - A combination of alphabetical characters (“Hello world”)
Numbers - Can all types (1, 12334, 1.5, -30)
Null - Nothing
Arrays - JSON array represents ordered list of values. JSON array can store multiple values. It can store string, number, boolean or object in JSON array.[1, 2, 3] [Hello world]
Booleans - True or false
Objects - Allow you to represent values that are “key value pairs” {key:value} {age:30}. Objects can be stored within an array. You can also nest objects within objects.



JSON FILES:

Typically in JSON, we’ll have an array or an object at the top of our file.
Then inside of that array or object, we'll have other values. 
*Remember it’s important to put commas between all the values in an array when writing JSON.
